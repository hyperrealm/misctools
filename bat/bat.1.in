.SH NAME
bat \- binary file dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
bat [ -c \fIchar\fP ] [ -hx8 ] [ -b \fIbaseaddr\fP ] [ \fIfile\fP ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbat\fP utility produces a hex dump of one or more named files,
or, if no files are listed, of data read from standard input. Each
line of output consists of a 32-bit hexadecimal offset (from the
beginning of the file), followed by 16 bytes of hexadecimal data,
followed by the same 16 bytes of data as represented by ASCII
characters.

Each file dump output begins with the name of the file and ends with
the file's byte count.
.SH OPTIONS

and as a decimal value otherwise.

.B -c \fIchar\fP
Display \fIchar\fP for nonprintable characters instead of the default
